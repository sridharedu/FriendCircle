# FriendCircle

Absolutely â€” hereâ€™s a **powerful, self-contained prompt** you can put in your `README.md` or feed into an AI to generate your full project. It captures **every constraint, decision, tech stack, architecture, and behavior** youâ€™ve locked in:

---

## ðŸ§  FriendCircle Project Prompt for AI

> **Prompt (README Usage or AI Boot Instruction):**

---

**Build a complete microservices-based backend project named `FriendCircle` based on the following exact requirements. Do not ask any questions. Just build the system as defined below.**

---

### âœ… Project Purpose:

A social platform backend where users can:

* Register, login (JWT-based)
* Add/update/delete their **own addresses**
* Send and accept **friend requests**
* View **friend-only data** (like hobbies)
* **Message** friends (Kafka-based messaging)
* View friend list and message threads
* Receive **notifications** on friend events and messages

---

### âœ… Architecture Constraints:

* **Microservices-based** backend
* Each service is **fully isolated**, independently deployable
* Use **Spring Boot 3.2+**, **Java 17**, **Maven**
* Use **REST for synchronous** service-to-service calls (Feign)
* Use **Kafka for asynchronous** messaging (no RabbitMQ)

---

### âœ… Required Microservices:

### âœ… Required Project Structure (Monorepo)

```
friendcircle/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ common-lib/               # Shared DTOs, Kafka config, utils
â”œâ”€â”€ config-service/
â”œâ”€â”€ discovery-service/
â”œâ”€â”€ gateway-service/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ user-service/
â”œâ”€â”€ address-service/
â”œâ”€â”€ friendship-service/
â”œâ”€â”€ hobby-service/
â”œâ”€â”€ message-service/
â”œâ”€â”€ notification-service/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ docker-compose.yml        # Compose setup for local dev
â””â”€â”€ devfile.yaml              # Dev environment configuration
```

---

### âœ… Runtime and Behavior Requirements

* JWT authentication is mandatory for all services (except config and discovery).
* Gateway must validate JWT and forward roles/userId as headers.
* All APIs should be RESTful, versioned (`/api/v1/`), with clear error handling.
* All user-to-user messages and friend events must flow via Kafka only.
* Every service must expose Actuator endpoints (`/actuator/health`, `/metrics`).
* Use Prometheus annotations for scraping metrics.
* Services should register with Eureka at runtime.
* Logging must be JSON-structured and routed to ELK via Logstash.
* Use consistent DTOs and mapper layers across services.

---

**Generate all services, config files, Dockerfiles, Kafka setup, health checks, metrics, and logs exactly as per the above definition. Do not omit any service or configuration. Do not propose alternatives. Build the complete production-grade codebase with clear separation.**

---
Here is a **complete list of JIRA-style tickets** for your `FriendCircle` microservices-based backend project. These tickets are:

* âœ… **Self-contained** (independent of others as much as possible)
* âœ… **Minimally scoped** (one core concept per task)
* âœ… **Functional** (each delivers a working feature, config, or proof of concept)
* âœ… **Educational** (helps you learn and apply key microservice/backend concepts)
